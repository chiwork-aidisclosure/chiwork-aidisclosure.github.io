## Call For Participation

Recent advancements in generative AI have raised questions about the disclosure, ownership, and accountability of human-AI co-created work. Specifically, when and how should we disclose AI usage to different stakeholders in various domains, and how do their perceptions of ownership influence the design, implementation, and evaluation of these disclosures? Furthermore, who is accountable for the benefits and risks of AI-assisted outcomes? These questions have profound implications for organizations and individuals navigating emerging policies, risks, and user needs in this space. The goal of this hybrid half-day workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from diverse disciplines to establish a collaborative community and explore research, policies, designs, technologies, and practices in this emerging field. 

Questions that could be explored include:
- Disclosure & Attribution: How do we determine and evaluate what disclosure and/or attribution means?
What are the next steps to operationalize those definitions for stakeholders?
- Ownership, Authenticity, and Perceptions: How can we determine who owns co-created work? How might
we preserve human ownership and authenticity? How can we shape our work environments to reduce potential
negative perceptions of AI use?
- Accountability & Responsibility: Who benefits from AI and who is accountable for the harms of AI outcomes?
How should we develop regulations to reduce harms and promote responsibility over AI outcomes?
- Implications for Work: How and when should AI disclosure be provided in various co-creative work contexts?
How might these choices privilege some workers over others?


We welcome submissions of full or in-progress studies, design fictions, literature reviews, demonstrations, encores of published work, and position papers. 
Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings (ArXiv) with the authors' consent. 
At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop and register for at least one day of the conference.
