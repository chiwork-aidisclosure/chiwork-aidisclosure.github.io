#### Scraping the Surface: Ownership and Ethics for AI Uses of Public Data 

*Abstract:* 
As generative AI systems are increasingly embedded in society, questions around where training data comes from—and whether it should have been used in the first place—are more pressing than ever. Much of this data comes from publicly accessible sources such as social media and websites, raising complex questions around copyright, consent, and privacy. This discourse connects to longstanding discussions in the research community regarding use of public data outside traditional human subjects research ethics frameworks. This talk unpacks ethical and legal tensions surrounding AI training data, including issues of attribution, unintended consequences, privacy harms, and exploitation of vulnerable groups.
